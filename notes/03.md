# Lecture 1.3 Shell Scripting

### Shell Scripting 
* All of the commads that are accessible from the shell can be placed into a shell "script"
* Shell scripts are executed line by line, as if they were eing typed in line by line

### Shell Script - High Level
* High level programming language
  * Variables, conditionals, loops, etc.
* Interpreted
  * No compiling, no variable declaration, no mem management
* Powerful/efficient
  * Do lots with little code
  * Can interface with any UNIX program that uses stdin, stdout, sterr
* String and file oriented

### When to Use Shell Scripts?
* Automating frequent UNIX tasks
* Simplify complex commands
* For small programs that:
  * .. you need to create quickly
  * .. will change frequently
  * .. need to be very portable
  * .. you want others to see and understand easily
* As a glue to connect together other programs

### Hello World!
\# !/bin/bash
\# Obligatory programming example
echo Hello World!

### Variable
* Create a variable by simply assigning it:
 myInt=1
 myStr=Ben
 mystr=123
* Get the value back out by using the $ operator in from of the variable:
myint=1
echo $myint

### Quote Marks - Protecting Your Text
* Quotation marks allow you to control the exapnsion of variable within strings of text, and group text into a single argument. 

* Single quotes(''): No variable expansion
$ printf 'all your base $abtu\n'
all your base $abtu
* Double quotes (""): Variable are expanded
$ printf 'all your base $abtu\n'
all your base are belong to us
* Backslash character (\\) means evaluate literally, instead of interpret:
$ nt="NOTTACHANCE"
$ printf "\$nt"; printf "$nt\n"
$ntNOTTACHANCE
 
### Printing Example - Built From Scratch
$ echo "#!/bin/bash"
-bash: !/bin/bash: event not found

$ echo "#\x21/bin/bash"
\#\x21/bin/bash

$ echo -e "#\x21/bin/bash"
$ echo -e "echo \"cat\"\necho \"kat\"\necho \"doug\"" | sort >> cAd
$ chmod +x cAd
$ cAd

### Editors and Word Processors
* Instead of using "echo >>" to build up a file, we typically use word processing programs like:
  * vi, emacs, pico

* You can wrtie UNIX on other OSs, but the differences in line endings in file formats is a challenge
  * dos2unix converts windows line endigns to those used by UNIX

### Shell Keywords
* Keywords are commands in bash that are interpreted by the hell as delimiters, branching constructs, and loops, among others.
* compgen generates possible completion matches for various categoris of keywords 
  * -k is all reserved keywords
* Can't use keywords as variable names

### Environment Varibles
* A set of variables that are always available in your shell
* These environment variabls control options that change the operation of the shell
* Here are a few common ones:
  * PATH - the set directories bash will search thru to fnid a command
  * HOME - a shortcut back to your home directory (~)
  * SHELL - the full path to the default shell
  * HOSTNAME - the name of the computer you're currently using 

### Environment Variables - PATH and HOME
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
$ echo $HOME
/Users/marctibbs
$ echo ~
/Users/marctibbs

### Special Parameters
* A set of variables that are always available in a script
* Here are a few common ones:
  * $ - the process ID of the script itself (Every running process has a unique PID"
  * ? - the return value of the previously terminated command or script
  * # - the number of arguments (positional parameters) given when a script is executed
  * 1 - the first argument (positional parameter) as of when the script was ran
  * 2 - the second argument (positional parameter) as of whne the script was ran 
  * 3, 4, etc.

### Retrun Values Examined
* The exit bash shell command + C exit() function return their results to the ? variable
* 0 is interpreted to mean no errors (normal execution), anything else is a result with specific meaning (usually an error)
$ cd aasdoiasd
aasdoiasd: No such file or directory.
$ echo $?
1

### The bash if Statement - Return Value Enabled
if command-list
then
  command-list
elif command-list
then 
  command-list
else
  command-list
fi

### Error Handling
* The shell will kepp executing even if commands have the wrong syntax, delete files, break things, and in general cause havoc
* If you want the shell to exit if any commands have a problem (ie return a non-zero value after executing, with some exceptions):
  * use -e with /bin/bash
* Most signals will kill script immediately
  * eg CTRL+C sends SIGNIT


### Protecting Your Thesis - Disastrous results

\#!/bin/bash -e (Add -e - will only be executed if the result of the previous command was 0)
cp thesis.docx thesis\_current.docx
rm -f thesis.doc


### Protecting Your Thesis - Another Fix

if cp thesis.docx thesis\_current.docx
then
  rm -f thesis.docx
else 
  echo "copy failed" 1>&2   (Take anything going to file descriptor 1 and redirect it to file descriptor 2 for the duration of this command.
  exit 1
fi

### Protecting Your Thesis - Yet Another Fix with test
* You can test for file existence, equality of strings, length, premissions, number equality, etc.

$ test 1 -ne 2
$ echo $? 
0
$ test 1 -ne 1
$ echo $? 
1

cp thesis.docx  thesis\_current.docx
if test $? -ne 0
then 
  echo "copy falied" 1>&2
  exit 1
fi
rm -f thesis.docx 

### for Loop Syntax

$ cat forloop
\#!/bin/bash
for i in a b c d
do
  printf "%s" $i
done
printf "\\n"
$ forloop
abcd

### while Loop Syntax
i=0
while test $i -ne 2  OR while [$i -ne 2]
do
  printf"i = $i, not stopping yet\n"
  i=$(expr $i + 1)
done
printf "Stopping, i = $i\n"

### Subshells
* some operators (like =) and commands reuire strings or numbers to operate on, other commands:
num2 = 3 + $num1 will not work

### Subshells 
* If we want to increment, or set to an arbitrary value, we first have to calculate that value and return it as text to the script, then the script can continue
* These are executed as entirely separate shells (called subshells) in their own processes that run and return

### Subshells
* Two ways to do command substitution with subshells:
i=\`expr $i + 1\`
i=$(expr $i + 1)

* Both methods evaluate the expression and grab the results from stdout of the subshell
* Double parenthsis construct does arithmetic expansion and evaluation directly, no expr command needed:
  i = $(( 9 + 9 ))
  (( i++ ))

### Common UNIX Commands - Trapping Signals
* Use the trap command to catch signals (like SIGTINT generated by hitting CTRL+C) and clean up yer mess
* Usage:
  trap <\code to execute> list of signals

* Example:
```
#!/bin/bash
TMP="myCoolFilename$$"
trap "rm -f $TMP; echo 'CTRL+C received, exiting'; exit 1" INT HUP TERM
echo "lotsa text" > TMP
while [ 1 -ne 2 ]
do 
  echo "Never ending loop - hit CTRL+C to exit!"
done
```
