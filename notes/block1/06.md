# 1.6 - Everything is a File

[**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WAcHc6Nz_M)

### Files!
* Files are "inodes" with "hard links" that point to them:

* Inodes are maintained by the file system itself and contain:
  * Pointers to actual file data 
  * All meta-info (size, permissions, etc)
  * A "reference count": how many hard links point to the inode
  * A unique "inode number"

### Hard Links
* A text entrty in a file system directory that points to an inode
* Connects a text filename to an inode on disk

### Directories!
* Directories are essentially text files that organize hard links hierarchically
* Create or remove directories with these UNIX commands:
  * mkdir, rmdir
* Because directories are files, you can also read the contents of a directory (in C):
  * opendir(), closedir(), readdir(), rewinddir()
* Directory hard link that represents itself: .
* Directory hard link that represents its parent directory: ..

### Creating Links
* When you create a file (using touch, a C function, etc.), an inode is allocated and a hard link is automatically created
* However, you can create multiple hard links to the same inode
  * So a file can appear in multiple directories at the same time!
  * THe same file can also appear under different names, even in the same directory
* To create a link, use the ln or link commands

### Removing Files in C
* Removing is approximately unlinking everything
  * THe inode is garbage collected when ref count == 0
* One way to "remove" a file:
  * unlink(file\_name)
  * can't unlink directories
* Another way to "remove" a file:
  * remove(file\_name)
  * unlike unlink(), remove will delete empty directories
  * if file, remove() is identical to unlink()
  * if directory, remove() is identical to rmdir()

### Symbolic Link
* Symbolic link is like a Windows shortcut - it's not actually a file, it points to a hard link
* If you delete, rename, or move the hard link a symbolic link points to, the symbolic link become unusable.
* You can symbolically link to directories or to file across the network
* Hard links are only available on the local file system

### Symboli Link Example
* I'm on a new server and want access to my home directort's files stored on my original server

```
NewServer$ ln -s /nfs/rack/u2/b/brewsteb ./myFilesLink
NewServer$ cd myFilesLink
```

* I am now in my filesystem on the new server

### Linking Example

```
$ mkdir 1
$ mkdir 2
$ touch ./1/hardlink ./2/hardlink2
$ ln ./1/hardlink1 ./2/hardlink2
$ ln -s ./1/hardlink1 ./symlink
$ find -samefile ./1/hardlink1
./1/hardlink1
./2/hardlink2
```

### What's in a directory
Possibilities include:
* Hard links
* Symbolic links
* Named pipes
* Device character special file
* Device block special file
* Named socket

### Permissions
* Files in UNIX have access permissions for three classes of users:
  * user (owner of the file - can set all permission)
  * group
  * all others

* Three kinds of access permissions for each:
  * read 
  * write
  * execute

* Every file belongs to exactly one user and one group

### Read Permissions
* File
  * The file's content can be read
* Directory
  * The directory's contents can be read (ie, a listing of the files in the directory can be returned

### Write Permissions
* File
  *  The file can be written to (ie, the contents of the file can be changed)
* Directory
  * Files can added/removed/renamed/etc. to/in the directory

### Execute Permissions
* File
  * The file can be executed (program, shell script)

* Directory
  * The directory can be cd'd into
  * File contents can be listed, and meta-info accessed, if name is known

### chmod
* You can change the permissions on a file using the chmod(change mode) command
* Here is a sample file listing (generated by ls -pla) of a file and dir:

-rw-r--r-- 1 brewsteb upg22026 4517 Jun 22 16:14 Prog2.html
drwx--x--x 1 brewsteb upg22026  512 Jun 22 17:48 tempDir/

* First dash indicates filetype, next 3 are the user, next 3 group, next 3 others permissions

## chmod - octal math
* The traditional method os assigning permissions with chmod uses octal
* Why does everything in UNIX have to be so hard
* r = 4
* w = 2
* x = 1
$ chmod 755 tempDir => drwxr-xr-x 1 brewsteb...

### Setting Permissions the Easy Way
* With this file:
`---------- 1 brewsteb upg22026 4517 Jun 22 16:14 Prog2.html`
* Set permissions like this:
``` 
$ chmod u+rwx Prog2.html
-rwx------ 1 brewsteb upg22026 4517 Jun 22 16:14 Prog2.html
$ chmod g+rw, o+rwx Prog2.html
-rwxr-xrwx 1 brewsteb upg22026 4517 Jun 22 16:14 Prog2.html
$ chmod 0-w Prog2.html
-rwxr-xr-x 1 brewsteb upg22026 4517 Jun 22 16:14 Prog2.html
```

### umask
* The creation mask setting defines the default permissions for new files
* You can set this mask with the UNIX utility umask
* If no argument is included, umask displays the current setting

### umask
* Since this is a mask we're talking about, it's inverted from what we saw with chmod
* Set the default permissions on new files to give the owner full priviledges, while the group and all others do not have write prvileges:
$ umask 022
* Note that execute permissions still are often not set by default, even if you umask indicated that they should

### umask
``` 
$ umask
0007
$ touch tempfile
$ ls -pla tempfile
-rw-rw----. 1 brewsteb upg57541 0 Mar 30 08:17 tempfile
$ rm tempfile
rm: remove regular empty file 'tempfile'? y
$ umask 022
$ umask
0022
$ touch tempfile
$ ls -pla tempfile
-rw-r--r--. 1 brewsteb upg57541 0 Mar 30 08:18 tempfile
```

### What are UNIX groups?
```
$ id
uid=57541(brewsteb) gid=20805(upg57541)
groups=20805(upg57541), 14013(ecampus-video), 19070(ecampusfiles), 12028(transfer)
```
* These groups are the same groups referred to when using the chmod command

### Common UNIX Commands - Directories & Files
* du - Returns the total usage in kilobytes of the specified directory
```
$ du .
4   ./inodetest/1
4   ./inodetest/2
16  ./inodetest
8   ./permissionstests
96  .
```
* df - Returns the total usage in kilobytes of filesystems
```
$ df . 
Filesystem 			   1K-blocks 	Used     Available Use% Mounted on
128.193.40.234:/stak_faculty/data  2147483648 1404256256 743227392 66%  /nfs/stak/faculty
```

* stat - Get details about a file

* touch - Create files and modiy time stamps

### Standard Directories
* Root dir:
  * /
* Home dir:
  * ~
* Bad idea:
  * rm -rf /\*
