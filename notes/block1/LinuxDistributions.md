# 1.2 Linux Distributions

### Linux Distributions 

#### [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org)
* Create your own Linux installation from source code, compiling everything! Super small, super fast, with only the components YOU need. Teaches you everything about Linux Architecture while building an OS.

#### [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org)
* Arch is one step removed from pure comilation. You'll have to install everything in this distribution. As you do that, you'll learn about what's required, and what's not. You can also make super fast and small distributions with this OS.

#### [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com)
* Ubuntu has become almost synonymous with Linux. It's fast, stable, and most importantly very easy to install. If you're just starting out, and want a nice Linux OS that comes with a desktop by default, all installable from a simple DVD, you can't go wrong with Ubuntu.

#### [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com)
* One negative about Ubuntu is that the GUI is a bit odd. The dev team is always trying new interfaces. Because of this, the Linux Mint team stabilized on a set of software and now works on improving lots of other parts of the OS, such as multimedia features. Linux Mint is now the most common desktop Linux distribution. It's slick, pretty, easy to use, and probably my favorite.
