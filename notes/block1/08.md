# 1.8 - Regular Expressions in UNIX

[**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUXwCwfh4tY)

### Regular Expressions
* Regular expressions are a way to specify a pattern of strings that you'f like returned as a part of a search
* Invented by Stephen Kleene in the 1950s

* REs are used by many UNIX programs:
  * grep, sed, vi, emacs, regexp, etc.
* Used extensive by many scripting languages:
  * Python, Perl, Tcl/Tk
* There is an entire course (CS321) that goes over REs, and other grammars

### Common UNIX Commands - Filtering with grep
* grep - search for an occurent of a string that matches a pattern
![grep](/notes/images/image03.png)
* Another grep example   
![grep](/notes/images/image04.png)

### Basic REs - Operators
* \* (asterisk) - Matches 0 or more of the previous character
  * Warning - this is different than Windows and UNIX command line usage
  * Known as the Kleene Star in the regualar grammar field
* ^ (circumflex) - When placed at the beginning of a RE, indicates the RE msut start at the beginning of the string
* $ (dollar sign) - When placed at the end of RE, matches the end of the string

### The Asterisk - 0 or more

|Pattern | Matches |
|--------|---------|
|A\*     |A or AA or AAA or ... |
|Ab\*     |Ab or Abb or Abbb or ... |
|FINDME\* | FINDME or FINDMEE or FINDMEEE...|

### Binding to Beginning and End
* Unless you use the ^ and $ operators, a RE will mach substrings

|Pattern | Matches |
|--------|---------|
|Jon | Will match any string that contains Jon anywhere |
|^abc | Any string that starts with abc | 
|XYZ$ | Any string that ends with XYZ |
|^Ben Brewster$ | Any string that matches "Ben Brewster" exactly |

### Single Character Matching 
* The following operators are available:
  *  . - Matches any single character
  *  \ - Causes the following special character to simply be itself
  * [abc] - Matches any one character inside the brackets
  * [^abc] - Matches any character **except** any of the ones inside 
* Any other non-special character matches itself

### Period Example 1
![grep](/notes/images/image05.png)


### Period Example 2
* \* - Means match any char any number of times
  * This is the "anything, any length" wildcard   
![grep](/notes/images/image06.png)

### Backslash Example 
* The backslash causes the REs to literally interpret special characters
|Pattern | Matches |
|--------|---------|
|\\.     | . |
|\$      |$  |
|\\\*    |\* |

### Brackets Example 1

### Brackets Example 2

### Brackets Example 3
![grep](/notes/images/image09.png)

### Ranges
* When using the square brackets [ ], you can specify ranges of characters to match
* The proper ordering is defined by the ASCII character set:
  * http://www.asciitable.com/    

|Pattern | Matches |
|--------|---------|
|[a-z] | a b c d e f .. y z|
|[^a-z]| Anything but the characters a-z|

### Or: |   
![grep](/notes/images/image10.png)

### Matching a Repeated Pattern
* We can search for a pattern that is repeated at least once
```
$ cat catsdogs
i like cats
i like dogs
i like catdogs
i like dogsdogs
$ grep "\(dogs\)\1" catsdogs
I like dogsdogs
```

### Matching a Repeated Pattern
* Curly braces specify the number of repeats (at least) that we're looking for to register a match
```
$ cat digs
dig
digdig
digdigdig
digdigdigdig
digdigdigdigdig
$ grep "\(dig\)\{3\}" digs
digdigdig
digdigdigdig
digdigdigdigdig
```
### Backreferences
* \\( \\) (parentheses) These operators will capture a matched strin g for later use
* \\1, \\2, etc. (escaped integer) This allows you to specify that the string should match the nth pattern that you have previously captures, where **n** is the number following the backslash

### Backreference example
```
$ cat likes
You like You
I like You
$ grep "\(You\) like \1" likes
You like You

* Note that the repeat example from earlier is actually a backreference:
$ grep "\(dogs\)\1" catsdogs
i like dogsdogs
```
### Finding Things - grep
* Find all lines in all files that match a string:
* r - search recursively down into each subdiretory
* n - Return the line number of matching lines
```
$ grep -rn "dogsdogs" ~
/nfs/stak/faculty/b/brewster/tempdir/greptests/catsdogs:4:i like dogsdogs
```

### Finding things - find - Example 1
* Find a file by name and many other features
* Can also execute commands against the files found(!)
```
$ find ~ -name digs
/nfs/stak/faculty/b/brewster/tempdir/greptests/digs
$ find ~ -name digs 2>/dev/null   (This gets rid of permission denied errors)
/nfs/stak/faculty/b/brewster/tempdir/greptests/digs
```

### Finding Things - find - Example 2
```
$ find ~ -name digs -exec rm -i '{}' \;
rm: remove regular empty file
'nfs/stak/faculty/b/brewster/tempdir/greptests/digs'? y
```

### Find Things - fnd - Example 3
* Find a file by name and many other features
* Find based on regular expression
```
$ find ~ -regex ".*fork.*" | sort
```

### Finding Things - locate
* find files using a database
* Faster than find, since it doesn't actually search the directoy hierarchy for the indicated files
* Will be outdated since last file location check
* Not available on every system
* Operates differently on those systems that do have it, due to different versions being installed on different OS
* ...just use find, which is ancient and universal
