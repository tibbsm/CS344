# The Vicious Interface

### If It's So Vicious and Old, Why Study vi?

* History 
  * Understanding why it exists and why it was created informs us about the underlying OS (UNIX) and the language it was developed in (C)

* Power
  * There are LOTs of things you can do in vi you can't do anywhere alse 
  * Important for manipulating large data files, repetitive commands, etc.

* Ubiquity 
  * Installed on every UNIX and UNIX-like system

* Necessity
  * Sometimes you'll have no other options bc of the environment

### Text Editors
* There are many text editors available on UNIX
  * ed (a line editor only)
  * ex (an extended line editor, vi's predecessor)
  * emacs

* vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976 for BSD
  * Added full-screen visibility to ex
* Its name comes from the shortest unambiguos abbreviation of **vi**sual

### What's a line editor?
* "[ed is] the most user-hostile editor ever created" - Peter Salus, computer historian

``` 
$ ed
a 
ed is the standard Unix text editor.
This is line number two.
.
2i

.
,1
ed is the standard Unix text editor.$
$
This is line number two.$
3s/two/three
,1
ed is the standard Unix text editor.$
$
This is line number three.$
w edfile
65
Q 
$ cat edfile
ed is the standard Unix text editor.

This is line number three.
```
### vi = Vicious Interface

* Just because it's got a full-screen interface, it doesn't mean it's easy to use - but it is very powerful
* In 1999, Tim O'Reilly, founder of the eponymous computer book publisher, stated that his company sold more copies of its vi book than its emacs book...
  * Not bc ore people like vi, but because it's harder to understand!
* Don't try to memorize all of the keystrokes as I present them here - just be aware they exist

### Modes, modes, modes
* vi features one of the first visual environments, instead of line editor

* Primary paradigm: vi is modal
  * Normal
  * Inser
  * Command
  * Visual
  * and a few others

### A Visual View of vi

### Actually, that was vim
* vim is **v**i **im**proved
  * Better than vi,, though the basic commands we're covering work in both
* vim is:
  * Still in development
  * vi is often mapped to simply start vim
* Starting vim
```
$ vim newFile
$ vim existingFile
```

### Modes for Real
* Normal 
  * Move around the document
  * Perform one-shot edit commands on characters, paragraphs, or even larger blocks of text

* Insert 
  * Insert text into the document
  * What normal WYSIWYG editors can only do

* Replace 
  * Overwrite mode

* Visual
  * Selects an area of text to which subsequent commands can be applied
  
* Command 
    * Whole file commands
        * Save, quit, search, etc.

### Normal Mode
* Movement 
    * Cursor movement
         * h,j,k,l - the Rogue keyset
         * $ - move to the end of the line
         * 0 - move to the beginning of the line
         * w - move to the beginning of the next word to the right
         * b - move back to the beginning of the previous word on the left
     * Screen movement
         * ^d - move screen down half a screen (ctrl-d)
         * ^u - move screen up half a screen (ctrl-u)

* How to get into Normal Mode
  * vi starts in Normal Mode
  * Hit escape to return to Normal Mode

### Insert mode 
  * Type like normal
  * Move around with the arrow keys
  * Hit 'i' to get into insert mode

### Replace 
* Overwrite mode
  * Non-Insertion typing
* Two ways to get into Replace Mode 
  * r - replace the character that the cursor is over with the next one typed
  * R - enter Replace Mode until we manually leave it [esc]

### Visual mode
* Visual mode allows you to select text and then apply commands to it
* What you have selected is marked by inverted characters

### Command Mode
* Used to enter commands that pertain (mostly) to the entire file
* These commands are actually carried over form the line editor ed
* To save you file, enter command mode (:), hit w, then enter
* If you started vi without a filename, you'll have to type in a name and then hit enter
* Can also be used to save a copy, but you'll still be editing the original file

### Quitting vi
* Quit - :q
* Save and then quit - :wq
* To exit w/o saving - :q!
* Normal mode, save current file and exit- ZZ

### Search and Replace 
* To find a string pattern in the file: /pattern
* n - goes to the next instance
* N - goes to the previous instance
* :nohl - removes highlighting
* :s/wrongtext/righttext/g - Global Search and replace

### Advanced Command Mode
* Run a single UNIX command (from inside vi):
  * :!UNIXCOMMAND
* Run a single UNIX command and insert the output into the file
  * :r!UNIXCOMMAND
* Put vi in the background, and start a new shell in the foreground:
  * sh

### Back to (Advanced) Normal Mode
* cut
  * in visual mode, use 'd' instead of 'y'
* Delete/cut a line
  * 'dd'
* Copy the current line
  * 'yy'
* Undo the last Normal Mode Command
  * 'u'
* Delete current character
  * 'x'
* Delete the current word
  * 'dw'
* Transpose current and next char
  * 'xp'
* Go into Append/Insert Mode at the end of the line
  * 'A'
* Open new line above the current line in Insert
  * 'O'
* Open a new line below the current line in Insert 
  * 'o'
* Delete the rest of the line from where the cursor is
  * 'd$'
* Delete the current char and enter Insert mode
  * 's'
* Join to lines
  * 'J'
* Delete 5 lines
  * '5dd'
* You can find further goofiness online on the vi resources pages
  * ~ switches case of letter
