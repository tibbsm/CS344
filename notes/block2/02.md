### A Brief History
* Developed by Dennis Ritchie (1914-2011) btwn 1969 & 1973 at Bell Labs
* C is a successor to B; however, B's inability to take advantage of the PDP-11's advanced features (to which cimputer Ritchie and Ken Thompson were busily porting UNIX) caused Ritchie to develop C
* UNIX was the re-written in C in 1072, which had been in development at the same time

### C is A High-Level Language
* As opposed to a low level language like assembly
* The original version of C (C89) has 32 reserved keywords, and 50+ operators and syntax characters
* C syntax widely influences programming lanaguage syntax development today

### HELLO WORLD
``` C
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hello world\n");
  return 0;
}
```

### Part Deux
``` C
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  char* oblig = "Hello World";
  float itsOver = 9000.0f;
  printf("%s\n", oblig);
  printf("IT\'S OVER %.2f!\n", itsOver);

  return 0;
}
```
Output:
$ hw2
Hello World
IT'S OVER 9000.00!

### Common String Shenanigans - Comparing
``` C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void main()
{
	char* boring = "boring";
	char* weirdDadSaying = "Eat more beef, kick less cats\n";
	int length;

	length = strlen(weirdDadSaying);
	printf("Length of entered string is = %d\n", length);

	if (strcmp(boring, weirdDadSaying) == 0)
		printf("Entered strings are equal.\n");
	else
		printf("Entered strings are note equal.\n");
```
