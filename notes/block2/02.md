* C is a successor to B; however, B's inability to take advantage of the PDP-11's advanced features (to which cimputer Ritchie and Ken Thompson were busily porting UNIX) caused Ritchie to develop C
* UNIX was the re-written in C in 1072, which had been in development at the same time

### C is A High-Level Language
* As opposed to a low level language like assembly
* The original version of C (C89) has 32 reserved keywords, and 50+ operators and syntax characters
* C syntax widely influences programming lanaguage syntax development today
