# Lecture 2.1 - C Review

### A Brief History
* Developed by Dennis Ritchie (1914-2011) btwn 1969 & 1973 at Bell Labs
* C is a successor to B; however, B's inability to take advantage of the PDP-11's advanced features (to which cimputer Ritchie and Ken Thompson were busily porting UNIX) caused Ritchie to develop C
* UNIX was the re-written in C in 1072, which had been in development at the same time

### C is A High-Level Language
* As opposed to a low level language like assembly
* The original version of C (C89) has 32 reserved keywords, and 50+ operators and syntax characters
* C syntax widely influences programming lanaguage syntax development today

### HELLO WORLD
``` C
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hello world\n");
  return 0;
}
```

### Part Deux
``` C
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  char* oblig = "Hello World";
  float itsOver = 9000.0f;
  printf("%s\n", oblig);
  printf("IT\'S OVER %.2f!\n", itsOver);

  return 0;
}
```
Output:
```
$ hw2
Hello World
IT'S OVER 9000.00!
```
### Common String Shenanigans - Comparing
``` C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void main()
{
	char* boring = "boring";
	char* weirdDadSaying = "Eat more beef, kick less cats\n";
	int length;

	length = strlen(weirdDadSaying);
	printf("Length of entered string is = %d\n", length);

	if (strcmp(boring, weirdDadSaying) == 0)
		printf("Entered strings are equal.\n");
	else
		printf("Entered strings are note equal.\n");
```
Output 

```
$ stringshenanigans
Length of entered string is = 30
Entered strings are not equal.
```

### Why Only Two Arguments? That's Weird Design

``` C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void main()
{
	char a[1000], b[1000];
	
	printf("Enter the first string\n");
	gets(a);

	printf("Enter the second string\n");
	gets(b);

	strcat(a, b);

	printf("String obtained on concatenation is %s\n", a);
}
```
Output
```
$ gcc -o getsstrcat getsstrcat.c
\tmp\ccJ1Kg0x.o: In function `main':
getsstrcat.c:(.text+0x20): warning: the `get" function is dangerous and should not be used.
$ getsstrcat
Enter the first string
mystring!
Enter the seconds string
so col!!@
String obtained on concatenation is mystring!so col!!@
```

### Substrings - Not Built-In!

``` C
#include <stdio.h>

void main() 
{
	char string[1000], sub[1000];
	int position, length, c = 0;

	printf("Input a string\n.");
	gets(string);

	printf("Enter the position of first char, a space, and length of substring\n");
	scanf(%d%d, &position, &length);

	while (c < length) {
		sub[c] = string[position + c - 1];
		c++;
	}
	sub[c] = '\0';

	printf("Required substring is \"%s\"\n", sub);
}
```
