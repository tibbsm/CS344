# Lecture 3.3 - Signals

[**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwS3dx3uyiQ)


## Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
* How can we connect our processes together? How can they communicate? Are there simple ways to do it?
* When a user process wants to contact the kernel, it uses a system call
* There are certain events that occur for which the kernel needs to notify a user process directly
* But how does the kernel or another process initiate contact with a user process?

## Signals
* Signals are the answer: they interrupt the flow of control (the order that individual instructions are executed) by stopping execution and jumping to an explicitly specified or default signal handler
* Critical point: signals tell a process to DO something - to take an action because of a user command or an event
* There are a fixed set of signals:
	* You cannot create your own signals, though the programmatic *response to* and *meaning of* most signals is up to you
	* There are two signals with no inherent meaning at all - you assign meaning to them by catching them and running code

## Uses for signals: Kernel to Process
* Notificatinos from the Kernel
	* A process has done something wrong
	* A timer has expired 
	* A child process has completed executing
	* An event associated with the terminal has occured
	* The process on the other end of a communication link has gone away

## Uses for signals: Process to process
* User process to user process notifications, perhaps to:
	* Suspend or resume execution of process
	* Terminate
	* Change modes
	* Change communication methods

## kill
* `kill -TERM 1234`
* The given PID affects who the signal is sent to:
	* If PID > 0, then the signal will be sent to the process PID given
	* If pid == 0, then the signal is sent to all processes in the same process group as the sender (from an interactive command line, this means the foreground process group, i.e. your shell)
	* More trickiness for pid < 0
* Let's test it out!

## Signaling a Script
```console
$ cat sigtermtest
#!/bin/bash
trap "echo 'SIGTERM Received! Exiting with 0!'; exit 0" SIGTERM
while [ 1 -eq 1]
do
	echo "nothing" > /dev/null
done
$ sigtermtest &
[1] 1708
$ psme
PPID 	PID 	EUSER 	 STAT	%CPU 	RSS		COMMAND

$ kill -SIGTERM 1708
SIGTERM Received! Exiting with 0!

```

## Signal Dictionary - Notification of Wrongdoing
![2](./images/3_2.png)

## Why Notify on Events? Branhing Logic!
* Gives the process a chance to clean up and finish any important tasks:
	* Perform final file writes
	* free() data
	* Write to log files
	* Send signals itself
* A process catching a signal and handling it will do all, some, or none of the above, and then either terminate itself or continue executing!

## Signal Dictionary - Control
![3](./images/3_3.png)

## Timers!
* If you want to wait a specified period of time...
	* You can do a busy wait which will consume the CPU continuously while accomplishing nothing
	* Or you can tell the kernel that you want to be notified after a certain amount of time passes
* To set a time in UNIX
	* Call the alarm() or ualarm() functions
	* After the time you specify has passed, the kernel will send your process a SIGALRM signal 

* This is how sleep() works:
	* sleep() calls alarm()
	* sleep() then calls pause(), which puts process into waiting state
	* when SIGALARM is received, sleep() finally returns

## Signal Dictionary: Child Process Has Terminated
![4](./images/3_4.png)
* Normally, wait() and waitpid() will suspend a process until one of its child processes has terminated
* Using the signal SIGCHILD allows a parent process to do other work instead of going to sleep and be notified via signal when a child terminates
* Then, when SIGCHLD is received, the process can (immediately or later) call wait() or waitpid() when ready, perhaps leaving the child a zombie for just a little while

## Signal Dictoinary: User-Defined Signals
![5](./images/3_5.png)
* SIGUSR1 & SIGUSR2 has no special meaning to the kernel
* THe author of both the sending and receiving processes must agree on the interpretation of the meaning og SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2

## SIGUSR1 Put Through its Paces
```console
$ cat sigchild
#!/bin/bash
set -m
trap "echo 'Triggering a child process termination with a silent ls'; ls > /dev/null" USR1
trap "echo 'SIGCHLD Received Exiting!'; exit 0" CHLD
whilel [ 1 -eq 1]
do
	echo "nothing" > /dev/null

## Abnormal Termination: Core Dumps
* Some signals received cause an "abnormal termination"
* This also occurs during runtime if the process crashes due to a segmentation fault, bus error, etc.
* When this happens, a memory core dump is created which contains:
	* Contents of all variables, hardware registers, & kernel process info at the time the termination occured
* This core fille can be used after the fact to identify what went wrong
* Depending on configuration, core dump files can be difficult to locate on your machine

## "Core" Etymology
> Magnetic-core memory was the predominant form of random-access computer memory for 20 years between about 1955 and 1975. Such memory is often just called core memory, or, informally, core.
>
> Core uses tiny magnetic toroids (rings), the cores, through which wires are threaded to write and read information. Three wires pass through each core.
>
> Each core stores one bit of information. A core's magnetization can be clockwise or counter-clockwise. The value of the bit stored in a core is zero or one according to the direction of that core's magnetization. The wires allow for the direction of the magnetization in the cores to be set, one core at a time, so that it stores either a one or a zero.
>
> The magnetizations of the cores are changed by sending pulses of electric current through selected wires. The process of reading the core **causes the core to be reset to a zero, thus erasing it.** This is called destructive readout. When not being read or written, the cores maintain the last value they had, even if the power is turned off. Therefore they are a type of non-volatile memory."
* Wikipedia, Magnetic-core memory, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory)

## Handcrafted Memory
> Using smaller cores and wires, the memory density of core slowly increased, and by the late 1960s a density of about 32 kilobits per **cubic foot** was typical. However, reaching this density required extremely careful manufacture, **almost always carried out by hand** in spite of repeated major efforts to automate the process. The cost declined over this period from about **$1 per bit to about 1 cent per bit.** The introduction of the first semiconductor memory chips, SRAM, in the late 1960s began to erode the market for core memory. The first successful DRAM, the Intel 1103, which arrived in quantity in 1972 at 1 cent per bit, marked the beginning of the end for core memory.[1] Improvements in semiconductor manufacturing led to rapid increases in storage capacity and decreases in price per kilobyte, while the costs and specs of core memory changed little. Core memory was driven from the market around 1973

## Signal Handling API
* Signals that hit your process will cause the default actino to occur (see the Signal Dictionaries above)
* To change this, organize signals into sets, then assign your own custom defined "signal handler" functions to these sets, to override the default actions and do whatever you want
* The next bunch of slides all discuss these signal handling functions, but first a few utility functions

## Sleeping With One Eye Open Utility: pause()
* Sometimes a process has nothing to do, so you consider calling sleep(), but you want it to be able to respond to signals, which it can't do in sleep()
* To handle this, use the pause() function

## Sleeping With One Eye Open Utility: pause()
* If a signal is set to be ignored, then the pause() continues to be in effect 
* If a signal causes a termination pause() does nothing (because the process dies)
* If a signal is caught, the appropriate signal handler function will be called. After the signal handler function is done, pause() returns -1 and sets errno to EINTR, and the process resumes execution
* You could then issue another pause(), for example, or continue on

## Sending Signals to Yourself - Utilties: raise() and alarm()
* You can send yourself a specified signal immediately with raise():
	* int raise(int signal);
* The alarm() function sends your process a SIGALRM signal at a later time
	* unsigned int alram(unsigned int seconds);
	* Note that alarm() will return immediately, unlike sleep()
	* You can only have one alarm active at any time

## Utility Type: Signal Sets
* A signal set is simply a list of signal types which is used elsewhere
* A signal set is defined using the special type sigset_t defined in <signal.h> 
* Functions for managing signal sets:
	* segemptyset(), sigfillset(), sigaddset(), sigdelset()

## Utility Type: Signal Sets
* To declare a signal set:
	* `sigset_t my_signal_set;`
* To initialize or reset the signal set to have no signal types:
	* `sigemptyset(&my_signal_set);`
* To initialize or reset the signal set to have all signal types:
	* `sigfillset(&my_signal_set);`
* To add a single signal type to the set:
	* `sigaddset(&my_signal_set, signal);`
* To remove a single signal type from the set:
	* `sigdelset(&my_signal_set, signal);`

## sigaction()
* sigaction() registers a signal handling function that you've created for a specified set of signals
	* `int sigaction(int signo, struct sigaction *newact, struct sigaction *origact);`
* The first parameter is the signal type of interest (SIGINT, SIGHUP, etc.)
* The second parameter is a pointer to a data-filled `sigaction` strcut which describes the action to be taken upon receipt of signal given in the first parameter
* The third parameter is a pointer to another `sigaction` strcut, with which the `sigaction()` function will use to write out what the handling settings for this signal were *before* this change was requested

## sigaction Structure
* Shares the same name as the sigaction() function, so don't get them confused!
```C
struct 
{
	void (*sa_handler) (int);
	sigset_t sa_mask;
	int sa_flags;
	void (*sa_sigaction) (int, siginfo_t*, void*);
};
```
* The first attribute should be set to one of three values:
	* SIGDFL :: Take the default action for the signal 
	* SIGIGN :: Ignore the signal
	* A pointer to a function that should be called when this signal is received (see next slide)

## Pointers to Functions in C
* They look complicated, but they are really simple
* In the sigaction structure, it is defined as
	* `void (*sa_handler) (int);`
* The "\*" in front of the name sa_handler, and the parentheses around it, indicate that this is a pointer to a function
* The "void" indicates that the function sa_handler points to does not return anything
* The "int" indicates that the sa_handler should point to a function that has one parameter: an integer
* This "int" will hold the signal number when sa_handler is called, which is important because multiple signals may be registered with this struct, and the int will be the only way to tell which signal caused the handler to start

## Using Pointer to Funcsiton
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int AddOne(int inputArg);

void main() 
{
	int (*fpArg) (int) = AddOne;
	printf("10 + 1 = %d\n", fpArg(10));
}

int AddOne(int input) 
{
	return input + 1;
}
```

## The sigaction Struct
```C
struct sigaction
{
	void (*sa_handler)(int);
	sigset_t sa_mask;
	int sa_flags;
	void (*sa_sigaction) (int, siginfo_t*, void*);
};
```
* the sa_mask attribute indicates what signals should be blocked while the signal handler is executing:
	* Blocked means that the signals arriving during the execution of sa_handler are held until your signal handler is done executing, at which point the signals will then be delivered in order to your process; note that multiple signals of the same type arriving may be combined, so you can't use this to count signals!
* Pass this a sigset_t as described above

## The sigaction Struct
```C
struct sigaction
{
	void (*sa_handler)(int);
	sigset_t sa_mask;
	int sa_flags;
	void (*sa_sigaction) (int, siginfo_t*, void*);
};
```
* The third attribute of the sigaction struct provides additional instructions (flags):
	* SA_RESTHAND :: Resets the signal handler to SIG_DFL (default action) after the first signal has been received and handled
	* SA_SIGINFO :: Tells the kerna to call the function specified in the fourth attribute (sa_sigaction), instead of the first attribute (sa_handler). More detailed information can be passed to this function, as you can see by the additional arguments
	* Set to 0 if you aren't planning to set any flags

## The sigaction Struct
```C
struct sigaction
{
	void (*sa_handler)(int);
	sigset_t sa_mask;
	int sa_flags;
	void (*sa_sigaction) (int, siginfo_t*, void*);
};
```
* The fourth attribute, sa_sigaction, specifies an alternative signal handler function to be called. This attribute will only be used if the SA_SIGINFO flag is set in sa_flags
* The siginfo_t struct pointer you pass in will be written to once sa_sigaction is invoked; it will then contain information such as which process sent you the signal
* The "void\*" pointer allows you to pass in a context, an obsolete, non-POSIX construct that manages user threads
* Most of the time you will use a sa_handler and not sa_sigaction

## Catching & Ignoring Signals - Part 1 of 2
```console
$ cat cathingSignals.cat
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdlinb.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void catchSIGINT(int signo) 
{
	char* message = "Caught SIGINT, sleeping for 5 seconds\n";
	// Can't use printf() during a signal handler, as it's non-reentrant; can't use strlen(message) in place of 38, as it's also non-entrant!
	write(STDOUT_FILENO, message, 38);
	//Send this process SIGUSR2; if this signal is blocked, it'll be delivered when the block is removed
	raise(SIGUSR2);
	sleep(5);
}

void catchSIGUSR2(int signo) 
{
	char* message = "Caught SIGUSR2, exiting!\n";
	write(STDOUT_FILENO, message, 25);
	exit(0);
}
```

## Catching & Ignoring Signals - Part 2 of 2
```C
main() 
{
	// Completely initialize this complicated struct to be empty
	struct sigaction SIGINT_action = (0), SIGUSR2_action =(0), ignore_action = (0);

	SIGINT_action.sa_handler = catchSIGINT;
	// Block/delay all signals arriving while this mask is in place. 
	sigfillset(&SIGINT_action.sa_mask);
	SIGINT_action.sa_flags = 0;

	SIGUSR2_action.sa_handler = catchSIGUSR2;
	// Block/delay all signals arriving while this mask is in place.
	sigfillset(&SIGUSR2_action.sa_mask);
	SIGUSR2_action.sa_flags = 0;

	ignore_action.sa_handler = SIG_IGN;

	sigaction(SIGINT, &SIGINT_action, NULL);
	sigaction(SIGUSR2, &SIGUSR2_action, NULL);
	sigaction(SIGTERM, &ignore_action, NULL);
	sigaction(SIGHUP, &ignore_action, NULL);
	sigaction(SIGQUIT, &ignore_action, NULL);

	printf("SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and SIGQUIT are disabled.\n");
	printf("Send a SIGUSR2 signal to kill this program.\n");
	printf("Send a SIGINT signal to sleep 5 seconds, then kill this program.\n");

	while(1) 
	{
		// Sleep but, wakeup to signals
		pause();
	}
}
```

## Catching & Ignoring Signals - Results
```console 
$ catchingSignals

```

## Child Processes and Inheritance
* When calling fork(), child processes inherit and get their own instance of the signal handler functions declared in the parent - these are assigned to the same signals as the parent automatically
* However, calling exec...() in your process will remove any special signal handler function you wrote and then assigned to sa_handler or sa_sigactino previously!
* **Critical Note**: SIGDFL and SIG_IGN *are* preserved through an exec...(). This is the only way to tell processes you exec...(), that you didn't write (like **ls**, other bash commands, etc.), to ignore partiular signals. In other words, there is no way to set up an *arbitrary* signal handler for programs you can't change: you can only set them to *ignore* specfic signals

## Blocking Signals
* It is also possible to block signals from occuring during your program execution *outside* of a signal handler function
* As before, blocking a signal simply means that it is delayed until you unblock the signal
* This could be useful if you have code where it is extremely critical that you don't get interrupted by any signal
* This kind of blocking is done with `sigprocmask()`

## Signals and System Calls
* Signals can arrive any time, including in the middle of a system call!
* System calls are savvy about signals and prevent data loss and corruption from occuring
	* They also prevent partial actions from happening
* Normally, system calls will return an error if a signal interrupts them, and set errno to EINTR
* You can tell system calls to automatically restart by setting SA_RESTART in tthe sa_flags variable of the sigaction struct
