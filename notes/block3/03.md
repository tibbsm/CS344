# Lecture 3.3 - Signals

[**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwS3dx3uyiQ)


## Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
* How can we connect our processes together? How can they communicate? Are there simple ways to do it?
* When a user process wants to contact the kernel, it uses a system call
* There are certain events that occur for which the kernel needs to notify a user process directly
* But how does the kernel or another process initiate contact with a user process?

## Signals
* Signals are the answer: they interrupt the flow of control (the order that individual instructions are executed) by stopping execution and jumping to an explicitly specified or default signal handler
* Critical point: signals tell a process to DO something - to take an action because of a user command or an event
* There are a fixed set of signals:
	* You cannot create your own signals, though the programmatic *response to* and *meaning of* most signals is up to you
	* There are two signals with no inherent meaning at all - you assign meaning to them by catching them and running code

## Uses for signals: Kernel to Process
* Notificatinos from the Kernel
	* A process has done something wrong
	* A timer has expired 
	* A child process has completed executing
	* An event associated with the terminal has occured
	* The process on the other end of a communication link has gone away

## Uses for signals: Process to process
* User process to user process notifications, perhaps to:
	* Suspend or resume execution of process
	* Terminate
	* Change modes
	* Change communication methods


## Signal Dictionary - Termination
| Signal | # | Easy Name | Catchable | Meaning of Signal Sent to Process | Default Action  If Not Caught | Core Dump |
|SIGABRT|6|Abort|Yes|Terminate; sent by process itself during abort() call which performs no cleanup, unlike exit()|Terminate|Yes|
|SIGQUIT|3|Quit|Yes|Terminate; sent by user|Terminate|Yes|
|SIGINT|2|Interrupt|Yes|The process is requested to terminate; performs cleanup; CTRL-C sends this to process and all its children|Terminate|No|
|SIGTERM|15|Terminate|Yes|The process is requested to terminate; performs cleanup|Terminate|No|
|SIGKILL|9|Kill|No|Terminate instantly, no cleanup; handled entirely by the kernel, nuke from orbit.|Terminate, not catchable|No|

## kill
* `kill -TERM 1234`
* The given PID affects who the signal is sent to:
	* If PID > 0, then the signal will be sent to the process PID given
	* If pid == 0, then the signal is sent to all processes in the same process group as the sender (from an interactive command line, this means the foreground process group, i.e. your shell)
	* More trickiness for pid < 0
* Let's test it out!

## Signaling a Script
```console
$ cat sigtermtest
#!/bin/bash
trap "echo 'SIGTERM Received! Exiting with 0!'; exit 0" SIGTERM
while [ 1 -eq 1]
do
	echo "nothing" > /dev/null
done
$ sigtermtest &
[1] 1708
$ psme
PPID 	PID 	EUSER 	 STAT	%CPU 	RSS		COMMAND
