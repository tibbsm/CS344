## The Process 
* Process Management is a necessary component of a multiprogrammable operating system
* Process:
  * An instance of an executing program, with a collection of execution resources associated with it

## UNIX Process Components
* A unique identity (process id aka pid) :: `pid_t pid = getpid();`
* A virtual address space (from 0 to memory limit)
* Program code and data (variables) in memory
* User/group identity (controls what you can access), unmask value
* An execution environment all to itself 
  * Environment variables 
  * Current workig directory
  * List of open files
  * A description of actions to take on receiving signals
* Resource limits, scheduling priority
* and more... see the exec() man page

## Programs vs Processes
* A **program** is the executable code
* A **process** is a running instance of a program
* More than one process can be concurrently executing the same program code, with separate process resources
