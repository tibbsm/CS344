# Everything is a File

### Files!
* Files are "inodes" with "hard links" that point to them:

* Inodes are maintained by the file system itself and contain:
  * Pointers to actual file data 
  * All meta-info (size, permissions, etc)
  * A "reference count": how many hard links point to the inode
  * A unique "inode number"

### Hard Links
* A text entrty in a file system directory that points to an inode
* Connects a text filename to an inode on disk

### Directories!
* Directories are essentially text files that organize hard links hierarchically
* Create or remove directories with these UNIX commands:
  * mkdir, rmdir
* Because directories are files, you can also read the contents of a directory (in C):
  * opendir(), closedir(), readdir(), rewinddir()
* Directory hard link that represents itself: .
* Directory hard link that represents its parent directory: ..

### Creating Links
* When you create a file (using touch, a C function, etc.), an inode is allocated and a hard link is automatically created
* However, you can create multiple hard links to the same inode
  * So a file can appear in multiple directories at the same time!
  * THe same file can also appear under different names, even in the same directory
* To create a link, use the ln or link commands

### Removing Files in C
* Removing is approximately unlinking everything
  * THe inode is garbage collected when ref count == 0
* One way to "remove" a file:
  * unlink(file\_name)
  * can't unlink directories
* Another way to "remove" a file:
  * remove(file\_name)
  * unlike unlink(), remove will delete empty directories
  * if file, remove() is identical to unlink()
  * if directory, remove() is identical to rmdir()
