# Everything is a File

### Files!
* Files are "inodes" with "hard links" that point to them:

* Inodes are maintained by the file system itself and contain:
  * Pointers to actual file data 
  * All meta-info (size, permissions, etc)
  * A "reference count": how many hard links point to the inode
  * A unique "inode number"

### Hard Links
* A text entrty in a file system directory that points to an inode
* Connects a text filename to an inode on disk

### Directories!
* Directories are essentially text files that organize hard links hierarchically
* Create or remove directories with these UNIX commands:
  * mkdir, rmdir
* Because directories are files, you can also read the contents of a directory (in C):
  * opendir(), closedir(), readdir(), rewinddir()
* Directory hard link that represents itself: .
* Directory hard link that represents its parent directory: ..
