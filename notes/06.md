# Everything is a File

### Files!
* Files are "inodes" with "hard links" that point to them:

* Inodes are maintained by the file system itself and contain:
  * Pointers to actual file data 
  * All meta-info (size, permissions, etc)
  * A "reference count": how many hard links point to the inode
  * A unique "inode number"

### Hard Links
* A text entrty in a file system directory that points to an inode
* Connects a text filename to an inode on disk

### Directories!
* Directories are essentially text files that organize hard links hierarchically
* Create or remove directories with these UNIX commands:
  * mkdir, rmdir
* Because directories are files, you can also read the contents of a directory (in C):
  * opendir(), closedir(), readdir(), rewinddir()
* Directory hard link that represents itself: .
* Directory hard link that represents its parent directory: ..

### Creating Links
* When you create a file (using touch, a C function, etc.), an inode is allocated and a hard link is automatically created
* However, you can create multiple hard links to the same inode
  * So a file can appear in multiple directories at the same time!
  * THe same file can also appear under different names, even in the same directory
* To create a link, use the ln or link commands

### Removing Files in C
* Removing is approximately unlinking everything
  * THe inode is garbage collected when ref count == 0
* One way to "remove" a file:
  * unlink(file\_name)
  * can't unlink directories
* Another way to "remove" a file:
  * remove(file\_name)
  * unlike unlink(), remove will delete empty directories
  * if file, remove() is identical to unlink()
  * if directory, remove() is identical to rmdir()

### Symbolic Link
* Symbolic link is like a Windows shortcut - it's not actually a file, it points to a hard link
* If you delete, rename, or move the hard link a symbolic link points to, the symbolic link become unusable.
* You can symbolically link to directories or to file across the network
* Hard links are only available on the local file system

### Symboli Link Example
* I'm on a new server and want access to my home directort's files stored on my original server

```
NewServer$ ln -s /nfs/rack/u2/b/brewsteb ./myFilesLink
NewServer$ cd myFilesLink
```

* I am now in my filesystem on the new server

### Linking Example

```
$ mkdir 1
$ mkdir 2
$ touch ./1/hardlink ./2/hardlink2
$ ln ./1/hardlink1 ./2/hardlink2
$ ln -s ./1/hardlink1 ./symlink
$ find -samefile ./1/hardlink1
./1/hardlink1
./2/hardlink2
```

### What's in a directory
Possibilities include:
* Hard links
* Symbolic links
* Named pipes
* Device character special file
* Device block special file
* Named socket

### Permissions
* Files in UNIX have access permissions for three classes of users:
  * user (owner of the file - can set all permission)
  * group
  * all others

* Three kinds of access permissions for each:
  * read 
  * write
  * execute

* Every file belongs to exactly one user and one group

### Read Permissions
* File
  * The file's content can be read
* Directory
  * The directory's contents can be read (ie, a listing of the files in the directory can be returned

### Write Permissions
* File
  *  The file can be written to (ie, the contents of the file can be changed)
* Directory
  * Files can added/removed/renamed/etc. to/in the directory

### Execute Permissions
* File
  * The file can be executed (program, shell script)

* Directory
  * The directory can be cd'd into
  * File contents can be listed, and meta-info accessed, if name is known
