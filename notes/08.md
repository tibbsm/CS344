* REs are used by many UNIX programs:
  * grep, sed, vi, emacs, regexp, etc.
* Used extensive by many scripting languages:
  * Python, Perl, Tcl/Tk
* There is an entire course (CS321) that goes over REs, and other grammars

### Common UNIX Commands - Filtering with grep
* grep - search for an occurent of a string that matches a pattern

* Another grep example

### Basic REs - Operators
* \* (asterisk) - Matches 0 or more of the previous character
  * Warning - this is different than Windows and UNIX command line usage
  * Known as the Kleene Star in the regualar grammar field
* ^ (circumflex) - When placed at the beginning of a RE, indicates the RE msut start at the beginning of the string
* $ (dollar sign) - When placed at the end of RE, matches the end of the string

### The Asterisk - 0 or more

|Pattern | Matches |
|--------|---------|
|A\*     |A or AA or AAA or ... |
|A\*     |Ab or Abb or Abbb or ... |
|FINDME\* | FINDME or FINDMEE or FINDMEEE...|
