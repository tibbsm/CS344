# Regular Expressions in UNIX

### Regular Expressions
* Regular expressions are a way to specify a pattern of strings that you'f like returned as a part of a search
* Invented by Stephen Kleene in the 1950s

* REs are used by many UNIX programs:
  * grep, sed, vi, emacs, regexp, etc.
* Used extensive by many scripting languages:
  * Python, Perl, Tcl/Tk
* There is an entire course (CS321) that goes over REs, and other grammars

### Common UNIX Commands - Filtering with grep
* grep - search for an occurent of a string that matches a pattern

* Another grep example   
![grep](/notes/images/image04.png)

### Basic REs - Operators
* \* (asterisk) - Matches 0 or more of the previous character
  * Warning - this is different than Windows and UNIX command line usage
  * Known as the Kleene Star in the regualar grammar field
* ^ (circumflex) - When placed at the beginning of a RE, indicates the RE msut start at the beginning of the string
* $ (dollar sign) - When placed at the end of RE, matches the end of the string

### The Asterisk - 0 or more

|Pattern | Matches |
|--------|---------|
|A\*     |A or AA or AAA or ... |
|Ab\*     |Ab or Abb or Abbb or ... |
|FINDME\* | FINDME or FINDMEE or FINDMEEE...|

### Binding to Beginning and End
* Unless you use the ^ and $ operators, a RE will mach substrings

|Pattern | Matches |
|--------|---------|
|Jon | Will match any string that contains Jon anywhere |
|^abc | Any string that starts with abc | 
|XYZ$ | Any string that ends with XYZ |
|^Ben Brewster$ | Any string that matches "Ben Brewster" exactly |

### Single Character Matching 
* The following operators are available:
  *  . - Matches any single character
  *  \ - Causes the following special character to simply be itself
  * [abc] - Matches any one character inside the brackets
  * [^abc] - Matches any character **except** any of the ones inside 
* Any other non-special character matches itself

### Period Example 1

### Period Example 2
* \* - Means match any char any number of times
  * This is the "anything, any length" wildcard

### Backslash Example 
* The backslash causes the REs to literally interpret special characters
|Pattern | Matches |
|--------|---------|
|\\.     | . |
|\$      |$  |
|\\\*    |\* |

### Brackets Example 1

### Brackets Example 2

### Brackets Example 3

### Ranges
* When using the square brackets [ ], you can specify ranges of characters to match
* The proper ordering is defined by the ASCII character set:

|Pattern | Matches |
|--------|---------|
|[a-z] | a b c d e f .. y z|
|[^a-z]| Anything but the characters a-z|
