# Lecture 2 - Introduction to UNIX

#### UNIX - 1965
* AT&T Bell Labs, MIT and GE develop a new time-sharing OS called Multics(MULTiplexed Information and Computer Sciences), which was the first OS to provide a hierarchichal file system.
 
#### UNIX - 1969
* Bell management pulls out of Multics project due to delays, but Bell researchers continue to experiment on their own.
* Bell labs Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Rudd Canaday, and Doug McIlroy create UNIX on a PDP-7
* While Multics was a large project; UNIX was just a few researchers

#### UNIX - 1970s
* 1/1/1970 becomes "time zero" for UNIX
* Text processing abilities added, allowing UNIX to start being used for actual work by another department at Bell labs. 
* UNIX now runs on PDP-11/20

#### UNIX - 1970s (II)
* First manual produced as online "man pages" (manual) on 11/3/1971
* UNIX re-written in C (created by Dennis Ritchie) in 1972, spurring further development in the C language itself.
* Presented to the outside world at the 1973 Symposium on Operating System Principles, but could not be turned into a product because of anti-trust regulations.

#### Linux
* Initially developed by Linus Tovalds to be a UNIX-like system, but not beholden to expensive license agreements with AT&T.
* Open source, protected by the GNU Public License (GPL)
* Supports the POSIX UNIX specification 
  * Code written for another POSIX-based UNIX (ie Solaris, HPUX, AIX, etc) shouldn'T need many changes to run on a Linux.
  * Linux knowledge will apply to most UNIX systems
* Stable, robust, free
* First version released 3/14/1994

### You Can Run Linux at Home
* There are many Linux distributions
  * Ubuntu, openSUSE, Red Hat, Debian, Arch Linux, Chrome OS, Mint, etc.
  * All can be downloaded; some can be purchased
  * EECS at OSU has several Linux machines you can connect to
* Distros are created with different purposes and features in mind
  * Ubuntu installs everything easily
  * Arch Linux is the opposite, requiring everything to be installed manually
  * Tails is built to be private from the ground up

### What Is The Shell?
* The UI to the operating system - a text-based, command line interpreter
* Provides access to all UNIX user-level programs
  * Start programs 
  * Manage processes (job control) 
  * Connect together processes (pipes) 
  * Manages I/O to and from processes (redirection)
  * Kill programs

### Shell Prompts
* Traditional prompt and cursor - your commands go after the prompt:
  $ ☐
* Can be customized:
  [1459] [tibbsm@flip1:~] ☐
  tibbsm@flip1@12:42:17$ ☐
  ~/CS344/prog1$ ☐
* A great place to create prompt code: http://exprompt.net/
* For example:
export PS1="\u@\h@\T\\$ "
* Place custom prompts with this line in ~./bashrc

### Shell Examples
* Type in a command after the prompt ($), and bash excutes it with the output:
$ ls (List all files)
$ ls -a (List all files + hidden files)

### Different UNIX Shells
* Basic Shells
  * Bourne Shell (/bin/sh)
  * C-Shell (/bin/csh)
* Enhanced Shells
  * BASH "Bourne-Again shell" (/usr/local/bin/bash)
  * TCSH enhanced C-Shell (usr/local/bin/tcsh)
  * Korn Shell (/bin/ksh)

### Most Common UNIX Commands
* Directory/file management
  * cd, pwd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, mv, cp, rm, ln, chmod
* File viewing and selecting
  * cat, more/less, head, tail, grep, cut
* Editors
  * vi, (x)emacs, pico, textedit
* Other useful commands
  * script, find, telnet, ssh, and many more

### Common UNIX Commands - Directories & Files
* pwd - Print working directory.
* cd - change directory
* ls - display files in directory. Accepts relative and absolute arguments
  * -pla option (a: all - l: long form - p: adds backslash to directories)
  * --color=auto
* alias - create a shortcut for running a program
  * alias l="ls -pla --color=auto"

### Common UNIX Commands - Directories & Files
* mkdir - create directory
* rmdir - delete directory
* rm - delete files (& directories if used recursively)
  * -rf (r:remove, f:force)
* mv - Move or rename files and directories
* cp - Copy files and directories
* touch - Makes new files or updates already made files time stamp

### Aside: Standard files and the Terminal 
* The shell automatically opens the terminal for reading-from, with one file and for writing-to with two files:
  * Standard In (stdin) [0]
  * Standard Out (stdout) [1]
  * Standard Error (stderr) [2]
* High level: if you don't specify otherwise, progra input and output goes to and from your shell prompt by default on every line
* We view and manipulate this input and output with the new few programs/commands

### Common UNIX Commands - Getting Data from Files
* echo - send character data to standard out
  * -e (interprets special characters such as \n)
$ echo -e "test text\nnext line"
test text
next line
* echo sends its data to stdout, which has not been explicitly changed away from the terminal
* The terminal dutifully displays data sent to it on your screen
