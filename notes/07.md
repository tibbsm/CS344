# The Vicious Interface

### If It's So Vicious and Old, Why Study vi?

* History 
  * Understanding why it exists and why it was created informs us about the underlying OS (UNIX) and the language it was developed in (C)

* Power
  * There are LOTs of things you can do in vi you can't do anywhere alse 
  * Important for manipulating large data files, repetitive commands, etc.

* Ubiquity 
  * Installed on every UNIX and UNIX-like system

* Necessity
  * Sometimes you'll have no other options bc of the environment

### Text Editors
* There are many text editors available on UNIX
  * ed (a line editor only)
  * ex (an extended line editor, vi's predecessor)
  * emacs

* vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976 for BSD
  * Added full-screen visibility to ex
* Its name comes from the shortest unambiguos abbreviation of **vi**sual

### What's a line editor?
* "[ed is] the most user-hostile editor ever created" - Peter Salus, computer historian

``` 
$ ed
a 
ed is the standard Unix text editor.
This is line number two.

Q 
$ cat edfile

This is line number three.

### vi = Vicious Interface

* Just because it's got a full-screen interface, it doesn't mean it's easy to use - but it is very powerful
* In 1999, Tim O'Reilly, founder of the eponymous computer book publisher, stated that his company sold more copies of its vi book than its emacs book...
  * Not bc ore people like vi, but because it's harder to understand!
* Don't try to memorize all of the keystrokes as I present them here - just be aware they exist

### Modes, modes, modes
* vi features one of the first visual environments, instead of line editor

* Primary paradigm: vi is modal
  * Normal
  * Inser
  * Command
  * Visual
  * and a few others

### A Visual View of vi

### Actually, that was vim
* vim is **v**i **im**proved
  * Better than vi,, though the basic commands we're covering work in both
* vim is:
  * Still in development
  * vi is often mapped to simply start vim
* Starting vim
```
$ vim newFile
$ vim existingFile
```

### Modes for Real
* Normal 
  * Move around the document
  * Perform one-shot edit commands on characters, paragraphs, or even larger blocks of text

* Insert 
  * Insert text into the document
  * What normal WYSIWYG editors can only do

* Replace 
  * Overwrite mode

* Visual
  * Selects an area of text to which subsequent commands can be applied
  
* Command 
    * Whole file commands
        * Save, quit, search, etc.

### Normal Mode
* Movement 
    * Cursor movement
         * h,j,k,l - the Rogue keyset
         * $ - move to the end of the line
         * 0 - move to the beginning of the line
         * w - move to the beginning of the next word to the right
         * b - move back to the beginning of the previous word on the left
     * Screen movement
         * ^d - move screen down half a screen (ctrl-d)
         * ^u - move screen up half a screen (ctrl-u)
