# The Vicious Interface

### If It's So Vicious and Old, Why Study vi?

* History 
  * Understanding why it exists and why it was created informs us about the underlying OS (UNIX) and the language it was developed in (C)

* Power
  * There are LOTs of things you can do in vi you can't do anywhere alse 
  * Important for manipulating large data files, repetitive commands, etc.

* Ubiquity 
  * Installed on every UNIX and UNIX-like system

* Necessity
  * Sometimes you'll have no other options bc of the environment

### Text Editors
* There are many text editors available on UNIX
  * ed (a line editor only)
  * ex (an extended line editor, vi's predecessor)
  * emacs

* vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976 for BSD
  * Added full-screen visibility to ex
* Its name comes from the shortest unambiguos abbreviation of **vi**sual

### What's a line editor?
* "[ed is] the most user-hostile editor ever created" - Peter Salus, computer historian

```

ed is the standard Unix text editor.

### vi = Vicious Interface

* Just because it's got a full-screen interface, it doesn't mean it's easy to use - but it is very powerful
* In 1999, Tim O'Reilly, founder of the eponymous computer book publisher, stated that his company sold more copies of its vi book than its emacs book...
  * Not bc ore people like vi, but because it's harder to understand!
* Don't try to memorize all of the keystrokes as I present them here - just be aware they exist

### Modes, modes, modes
* vi features one of the first visual environments, instead of line editor

* Primary paradigm: vi is modal
  * Normal
  * Inser
  * Command
  * Visual
  * and a few others
